### Banking Management System (Apna Bank)
This is a Banking Management System that leverages Object-Oriented Programming principles and Data Structures. In this project, we have implemented the following data structures: LinkedList and Queues.

## The program utilizes the following programming constructs to create its functionality:
✔️ Classes
✔️ Constant Functions/Variables
✔️ Linked List
✔️ Queues
✔️ Conditional Statements/Selection Statements
✔️ Iterative Procedures

## The program has four main objectives:

✔️ Allow the User to access the bank.
✔️ Provide the User with access to the ATM.
✔️ Grant User (Admin) access to the restricted area.
✔️ Offer the User an option to exit.

# Program Functionality/Sequence:

The program encompasses various functions that users can perform. Upon executing the program, users will encounter a welcoming screen, prompting them to press any key to enter the menu.

Once inside the menu, users will be presented with four options:

✔️ Enter the Bank
✔️ Enter the ATM
✔️ Administrator (Restricted)
✔️ Exit

## If the user selects option 1, they will be directed to the bank section with the following choices:

✔️ Pay a Bill
✔️ Withdraw/Deposit Cash
✔️ Open a New Account
✔️ View Account (Enter Username & Password)
✔️ Exit to Main Menu

## If the user chooses option 2, they will access the ATM section, which includes the following choices:


# Enter Pin and Debit Card number
    a. Withdraw Cash
    b. Change Pin (Requires Current Pin)
    c. Balance Enquiry
    d. Exit
    
## If option 3 is selected, the user will be taken to the Administration section, which provides the following options:


# Enter Username and Password to proceed.
    a. View Bill Payment Queue in the Bank
    b. View Account Opening Queue and Process Accounts
    c. Exit
    
## Opting for option 4 will lead the user to a farewell screen, where they are prompted to press any key to exit the program.
